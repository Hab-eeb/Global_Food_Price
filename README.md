# Global_Food_Price
This project aims to understand and analyze fluctuations in global food prices and pair the

outcome with currency fluctuations, weather patterns, and refugee movements. This will help us

to build an end-to-end analysis and a food price prediction engine that will help the Government

make better decisions on food policy adjustments, International bodies with planning of food aid programmes, Individuals with planning and productivity in the advent of a potential food price

crisis..
